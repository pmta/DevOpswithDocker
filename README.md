# DevOpswithDocker


The repository is organised in folders by the course Part with separate folder for each exercise.
```
part1/
:
|-- 1.6/
|   |-- answer.txt
|   |-- Dockerfile
|   |-- log.txt
|--1.7/
|   |-- answer.txt
|   |-- curler.sh
|   |-- Dockerfile
|   |-- log.txt
:
```

"answer.txt" contains the answer to an exercise.

"Dockerfile" is the Dockerfile for exercise where requested.

"log.txt" is command/output log (incase I need the details later)

Other files ("curler.sh", "logs.txt" etc.) which exists under some exercises are 
something needed for building the container or output from container.
