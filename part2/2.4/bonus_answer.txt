Bonus / alternative solution
Mody the compute on docker compose an add replicas as follows:
#  compute:
#      build: ./compute
#      image: compute
#      deploy:
#        replicas: 2
#      environment:
#        - VIRTUAL_HOST=compute.localtest.me

and run
docker-compose --compatibility up


The docker-compose file reference version 3 lists "deploy" effective when deploying to swarm or with docker stack deploy.
And claims deploy is ignored by docker-compose up. However with --compatibility  option docker-compose up seems to work also.

# https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/

Section "deploy"
# Specify configuration related to the deployment and running of services. This only takes 
# effect when deploying to a swarm with docker stack deploy, and is ignored by 
# docker-compose up and docker-compose run.
