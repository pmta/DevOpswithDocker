Using the generated URL, Jupyter environment can be connected with web browser to run Jupyter notebooks.
Example notebook "notebooks/RecurrentNetworks.ipynb" included for testing.
The RecurrentNetworks.ipynb can be opened with web browser from "notebooks" folder and run from menu "Cell" -> "Run All".

Note running the playbook takes rather long. It can be stopped from menu "Kernel" -> "Interrupt".
(The notebook itself tries to use recurrent networks for text generation.)


The container can be used as interactive python environment if run as:
# docker run -it anaconda3 ipython3

The container has Anaconda "package manager" called "conda" which can be used
to install additional  packages/libraries to Anaconda environment.

For example to install pytorch:
# docker run -it pmta/anaconda3 conda install pytorch

Refer to project README for more details and the folder "/home/$user/.local/bin/" inside the 
container for available tools.
